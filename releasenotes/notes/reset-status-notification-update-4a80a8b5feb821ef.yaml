    `Bug #1863806 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1863806>`_:
    ``os-reset_status`` notifications for volumes, snapshots, and
    backups were being sent to nonstandard publisher_ids relative to
    other cinder notifications for volumes, snapshots, and backups.
    Now they are also sent to the following *standard* publisher_ids,
    where most people would expect to find them:

    * 'volume' for volume status resets
    * 'snapshot' for snapshot status resets
    * 'backup' for backup status resets
