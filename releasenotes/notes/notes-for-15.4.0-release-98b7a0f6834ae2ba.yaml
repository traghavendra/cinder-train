    The Cinder project team would like to point out some issues addressed
    by this release:

    * The online data migrations for Train have been updated to address
      an upgrade issue (`Bug #1893107
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1893107>`_).  The issue does
      not manifest itself in the Train release of cinder, but under specific
      circumstances it can prevent a cinder database upgrade from Train to
      Ussuri.  See the "Upgrade Notes" and "Bug Fixes" sections below for
      more information.

    * This release improves the handling of the ``__DEFAULT__`` volume-type
      (see "Other Notes", below) and fixes `Bug #1879578
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1879578>`_, in which the
      default type was applied too aggressively (see the discussion of
      this issue in "Bug Fixes", below).

    * Operators affected by `OSSN-0086
      <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0086>`_ should note that
      this release updates the os-brick library used by cinder to version
      2.10.5 in order to address an issue associated with the previous
      fixes for `Bug #1823200
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_.

    This release updates the os-brick library used by Cinder to version
    2.10.5 to correct hopefully the final problem with the fix for
    `Bug #1823200
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_ in the previous
    os-brick release.

    See the `os-brick 2.10.5 release notes
    <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/os-brick/train.html#relnotes-2-10-5-stable-train>`_
    for more information.
